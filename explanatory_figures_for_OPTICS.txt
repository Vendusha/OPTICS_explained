This script generates figures for understanding the operation of the OPTICS algorithms. 
The figure for generating point M core distance is fixed for colors for explanatory purposes.
There is a distinction between epsilon max and extraction of the clusters from the reachability plot again for explanatory purposes. 
The script can be run by python OPTICS_explained.py
